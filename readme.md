I am a Ui Path RPA Developer with knowledge of computer networking and many years of technical troubleshooting experience. I graduated with an associate degree in Computer Networking Technology in 2017 from Brightwood College. One project I worked on was taking apart a computer case, reassembling it, and making sure it worked and connected to the network.

My most recent job was at the Social Security Administration, where I provided nationwide troubleshooting and technical assistance to all SSA employees. Here I gained in-depth analytical and problem-solving skills. I was also exposed to working in a team environment, collaborating with members to fix problems and meet strict SLAs.

At Revature, I’ve built and configured robotic processes, while utilizing SQL, Vb.Net, CSS, and JavaScript. Rosa was an automation I built that searches a client shopping list, then dynamically buys the products for its clients. I also built a website for Rosa to shop from implementing bootstrap.

I also worked on many projects collaborating with team members using the agile methodology. Other stacks I’ve learned are email automation, selectors, manipulating variables, pdf automation, Excel automation, git, and Robotic Enterprise Framework. I also published projects on Orchestrator and worked with assets and queues.

I am eager to expand on this knowledge, to learn and grow.
